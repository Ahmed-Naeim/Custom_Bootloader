# STM32F103C8T6 Bootloader Implementation

## Introduction

Hello there! I'm Ahmed Mohamed Naeim, and I'm excited to share the achievements from my journey during Eng. Ahmed Abelghafar's Diploma in Kernel Masters. In this immersive experience, I delved into the world of embedded systems, focusing on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller architecture.

## Implemented Commands

During the course, I successfully implemented and configured several key commands for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller:

1. **Bootloader Get Version**
   - Retrieves information about the current bootloader version.

2. **Bootloader Get Help**
   - Provides a helpful guide on available commands and their usage.

3. **Bootloader Get Chip Identification Number**
   - Fetches the unique identification number of the STM32 chip.

4. **Bootloader Read Protection Level**
   - Reads the current flash memory protection level.

5. **Bootloader Jump to Address**
   - Initiates a jump to a specified memory address.

6. **Bootloader Erase Flash**
   - Erases the flash memory to prepare for new data.

7. **Bootloader Memory Write**
   - Writes data to the specified memory location.

8. **Bootloader Enable Read/Write Protection**
   - Enables read/write protection for secure memory areas.

9. **Bootloader Memory Read**
   - Reads data from a specified memory location.

10. **Bootloader Get Page Protection Status**
    - Retrieves the protection status of memory pages.

11. **Bootloader Read OTP**
    - Reads the One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory.

12. **Bootloader Disable Read/Write Protection**
    - Disables read/write protection for secure memory areas.

## Core Concepts Explored

Behind these commands lies a solid understanding of core concepts such as bootloader functionality, memory layout, and the diverse applications of bootloaders.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my sincere thanks to Eng. Ahmed Abelghafar for guiding me through this enriching journey!
