# STM32F103C8T6 Bootloader Implementation

## Introduction
I am pleased to present the successful implementation of a bespoke bootloader for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. This project aimed to address [briefly mention the motivation or goals].

## Implemented Commands
Throughout this undertaking, I meticulously devised and configured key commands tailored for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller:

1. **Bootloader Get Version:**
   - Retrieves information about the current bootloader version.

2. **Bootloader Get Help:**
   - Provides a comprehensive guide on available commands and their usage.

[...and so on for other commands...]

These commands augment functionality and control for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.

## Core Concepts Explored
A profound comprehension of critical concepts, such as bootloader functionality, memory layout, and bootloader applications, was instrumental in the success of this project. These concepts form the bedrock of effective STM32 development and significantly contributed to achieving our project objectives.

## Validation Tools
To rigorously validate the custom bootloader, the following professional-grade tools were employed:

- **USB to Serial Port Download Line CH340G RS232 Module USB to TTL:** Utilized for seamless serial communication between the development environment and the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.

- **Host File:** Employed to host the firmware image and facilitate communication with the bootloader.

- **ST-Link Utility:** Applied for robust flashing and debugging of the STM32 microcontroller.

- **Realterm (Serial Capture Program):**
  - Used for capturing and analyzing serial communication, providing valuable insights during the validation process.

- **[Keil M5 or STM32 Cube IDE or any other familiar IDE for Implementation]:** Choose your preferred integrated development environment for the meticulous implementation and testing of the custom bootloader.
